## Use this image

### Docker Compose

Docker compose is the recommended way to run this image. Copy the content of folder [examples/compose](examples/compose) in `/var/fail2ban/` on your host for example. Edit the compose and env files with your preferences and run the following commands :

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Command line

You can also use the following minimal command :

```
docker run -d --name fail2ban --restart always \
  --network host \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add NET_RAW \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  -v /var/log:/var/log:ro \
  crazymax/fail2ban:latest
```

## Notes

### `DOCKER-USER` chain

In Docker 17.06 and higher through [docker/libnetwork#1675](https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/pull/1675), you can add rules to a new table called `DOCKER-USER`, and these rules will be loaded before any rules Docker creates automatically. This is useful to make `iptables` rules created by Fail2Ban persistent.

If you have an older version of Docker, you may just change `F2B_IPTABLES_CHAIN` to `FORWARD`. This way, all Fail2Ban rules come before any Docker rules but these rules will now apply to ALL forwarded traffic.

More info : https://docs.docker.com/network/iptables/

### `DOCKER-USER` and `INPUT` chains

If your Fail2Ban container is attached to `DOCKER-USER` chain instead of `INPUT`, the rules will be applied **only to containers**. This means that any packets coming into the `INPUT` chain will bypass these rules that now reside under the `FORWARD` chain.

This implies that [sshd](examples/jails/sshd) jail for example will not work as intended. You can create another Fail2Ban container. Take a look at [this example](examples/compose-multi).

### Use fail2ban-client

[Fail2ban commands](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Commands) can be used through the container. Here is an example if you want to ban an IP manually :

```
docker exec -t <CONTAINER> fail2ban-client set <JAIL> banip <IP>
```

### Global jail configuration

You can provide customizations in `/data/jail.d/*.local` files.

For example to change the default bantime for all jails, send an e-mail with whois report and relevant log lines to the destemail:

```
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 1h
destemail = root@localhost
sender = root@$(hostname -f)
action = %(action_mwl)s
```

> :warning: If you want email to be sent after a ban, you have to configure SSMTP env vars

FYI, here is the order *jail* configuration would be loaded:

```
jail.conf
jail.d/*.conf (in alphabetical order)
jail.local
jail.d/*.local (in alphabetical order)
```

A sample configuration file is [available on the official repository](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/master/config/jail.conf).

### Custom jails, actions and filters

Custom jails, actions and filters can be added respectively in `/data/jail.d`, `/data/action.d` and `/data/filter.d`. If you add an action/filter that already exists, it will be overriden.

> :warning: Container has to be restarted to propagate changes

### Jail examples

Jail examples can be found in [examples/jails](examples/jails) to work with this image.
